## CJI-SPI-CCC Tutorial: Ocean temperature evolution in Crystal Cove
by Mariana Torres and Julia Lenhardt

---
#### **Interested in seeing how ocean temperature has changed over time in Crystal Cove?**

Follow the steps below:

**Objective:** This tutorial provides a hands-on programming activity to explore, plot, and analyze ocean temperature data. You'll practice basic exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, data visualization, and statistical techniques applied to marine heatwaves. The activity uses a public dataset from the Southern California Current System.

**To start, you will need to:**

1. Create a Google account: This is because Google Colab is a hosted [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) service that provides free of charge access to computing resources. If you don't have a free Google account, you can create one [here](https://www.google.com/account/about/)
2. Enable *Google Colab* in your Google account:
	1. To do this go to the [Google Workspace page for Colab](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/colaboratory/1014160490159)
	2. Click the “Install” button and follow the prompts
	3. *If Colab is already installed, the button will say “Uninstall”. In such case you can skip this step and go to step 3*
3. Create a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) to store your work:
	1. Name the folder how it best fits your personal organization scheme: e.g. “CCC_temperature_analysis_example”
4. The Google Colab Notebook is hosted on a GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/marianatorres4/TutorCove/blob/main/CCC_Temperature_analysis.ipynb):
	1. The link above opens a static version of the notebook named “CCC_Temperature_analysis.ipynb”
	2. Click on the upper left corner button that says “Open in Colab”. This will open the notebook in the Colab environment
	3. Make a copy of the notebook and save it in the folder you made previously. Click on File > Save a copy in Drive
5. Continue to step 6, which is continued on the notebook
